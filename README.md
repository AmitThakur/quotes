##### q002
> I often say that when you can measure what you are speaking about and express it in numbers you know something about it; but when you cannot express it in numbers your knowledge is a meagre and unsatisfactory kind: it may be the beginning of knowledge but you have scarcely, in your thoughts, advanced to the stage of science, whatever the matter may be. 

**-Lord Kelvin**

##### q003
> Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted.

**-Albert Einstein**
