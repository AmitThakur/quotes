> *I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.*
> -Confucius


> *I often say that when you can measure what you are speaking about and
express it in numbers you know something about it; but when you cannot
express it in numbers your knowledge is a meagre and unsatisfactory
kind: it may be the beginning of knowledge but you have scarcely, in your
thoughts, advanced to the stage of science, whatever the matter may be.*
